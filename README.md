# Techdegree Project 1 - Random Quote Generator
For this project I was tasked with creating a list of quotes that would be appended to the page dynamically.
After completing this project, as a bonus challenge I added functions to change the background color, and print a new quote after 8 seconds. Additionally, the timer is reset when the button is pressed.
